## Areas for Improvement
* While it is generally recommended to avoid the use of relative paths, I opted for their simplicity during the development of this project. My primary focus was on implementing and achieving the expected functionalities. For larger scope projects, configuring absolute paths is advisable

* Minimizing the use of let and var in favor of const is often advisable for maintaining code in real-world applications. This is because const enforces immutability, meaning once a value is assigned, it cannot be altered. This is especially important in applications with client-side interaction. In this project, I opted for using let primarily to expedite feature implementation and to prioritize immediate outcomes. While this approach enhanced development speed and focus on results, it may have implications on the long-term maintainability of the code

* Avoiding the use of inline styles is also recommended for real-world applications considering factors like scalability and dynamic styling limitations
